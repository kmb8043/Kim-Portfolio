# Kim's Portfolio

This is my profolio page. It showcases a few of my projects that I have worked on. 

## Description

This porfolio page has a little information about me and a list of skills that I have learned along my coding journey( I am sure I may have missed a few ðŸ˜…).
The page also includes an interactive portfolio. When the viewer clicks on the projects it will direct them to the GitHub repository for that project. At the bottom of the page the viewer will find a contact me. The views message and other information will get sent to my app.getform.io.
