                I was 31 years old when I decided to make a career change. I studied criminal justice in college and jumped into workin for the Federal Government working as a Security Officer and a Law Enforcement Officer. <p> I discovered coding through my older sister and my husbands brother. I played around on Khan Academy to get my feet wet and watch many youtube videos before taking the leap. </p> <p>I have always loved learning new skills and challenging myself. Coding gives me the mental challenge everyday.</p>
